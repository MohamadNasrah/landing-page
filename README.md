This is the "Landing Page" exercise that i need to do to test my newly acquired css skills.

I will not add content at first and only abide to the placeholder text and images The Odin Project provided
in the .png.

The purpose of this repo is to style the page so the content inside is not that important,
although i might add some personalized content a later stages.
